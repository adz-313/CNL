Part A: Setup a wired LAN using Layer 2 Switch and then IP switch of minimum four computers. It includes preparation of cable, testing of cable using line tester, configuration machine using IP addresses, testing using PING
 utility and demonstrate the PING packets captured traces using Wireshark Packet Analyzer Tool.Part B:
 Extend the same Assignment for Wireless using Access Point.

Write a program in C/C++ for error detection and correction for 7/8 bits ASCII codes using Hamming Codes or CRC. Demonstrate the packets captured traces using Wireshark Packet Analyzer Tool for peer to peer mode. ( 50% students will
 perform Hamming Code and others will perform CRC)

Write a program in Java/Python to demonstrate sub netting and find the sub net masks.

Installing and configure DHCP server and write a program (C++\Python\Java) to install the software on remote machine.

Write a program in C/C++ using UDP Sockets to enable file transfer (Script, Text, Audio and Video one file each) between two machines. Demonstrate the packets captured traces using Wireshark Packet Analyzer Tool for peer to peer
 mode.

Write a program in C/C++ using TCP socket for wired network for followinga. Say Hello to Each other ( For all students)b. File transfer ( For all students)c. Calculator (Arithmetic) (50% students)d. Calculator (Trigonometry) (50%
